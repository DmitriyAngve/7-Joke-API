# 7-Joke-API

This App fetching data from Chuck Norris API and get jokes back from that API.

Some of these jokes there might be not your style, some of the jokes might be offensive.

I was connected to that endpoint, and getting some of the content back in order to practice.

Page a fully interactive web application, that's ging to be driven from JSON data within the API.

## Implemented fetures:

At the top of the page are the categories of the jokes, they are clickable. Click on categories button allows to get a random joke from cetegory. Text of the jokes output on the page.
I made the jokes text fairly smal because I don't want too much focus too much on the text, but more on the JSON data.
You can also search for a search term and that will return back the joke according to whatever the search.


Unpretentious style included!
